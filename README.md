# Nim Markdown Parser

This is a personal project, where I experiment with Markdown parsing using
Nim. The goal is to implement a subset of Markdown that I will be using
in my Campaign Mapper project, so that I can export this code as a
typescript library and consume it there.

## Libraries used

* nre
* strutils
* strformat
* nimble
* unittest
